# Secretary of War Simulator - Quick Setup Guide

## What You Need
1. GTA V installed
2. RagePluginHook (latest version)
3. This mod (NarcoBoatsRPH.dll)

## Installation (Takes 2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install the Mod
1. Copy `NarcoBoatsRPH.dll` to your GTA V `Plugins\` folder
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\Plugins\
   ```

2. That's it! The mod will auto-create its config file on first run.

### Step 2: (Optional) Add Radio Chatter
1. Create this folder structure:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\lspdfr\audio\scanner\NarcoBoats\
   ```

2. Put your WAV audio files in the `NarcoBoats\` folder
   - Files must be WAV format (not MP3)
   - Name them whatever you want (good_hit.wav, splash.wav, etc.)
   - They'll play randomly when you destroy boats

### Step 3: Launch and Play
1. Start GTA V through RagePluginHook (NOT through Steam/Rockstar launcher)
2. Load into single-player
3. Press **F6** to start a mission
4. Destroy all the boats!

## First Mission Tips
- You'll spawn in a Hunter helicopter (best for this mission)
- Use **homing missiles** to lock onto red-marked boats
- Boats have drug packages visible on them
- Complete waves to progress (each wave has more boats)
- Check your stats when you finish!

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin won't load?**
- Make sure you're launching through RagePluginHook
- Check RagePluginHook.log for errors
- Verify the DLL is in the Plugins folder

**No audio?**
- Check that your WAV files are in: `lspdfr\audio\scanner\NarcoBoats\`
- Files MUST be WAV format
- Check the AudioFolder path in your config

**Boats not spawning?**
- Make sure you're in single-player mode
- Try pressing F4 and selecting "Reload Plugins"
- Check your config file settings

**Game crashes?**
- Lower MaxDrugProps to 6 in the config file
- Lower StartingBoatCount to 3
- Try using the Buzzard helicopter instead of Hunter

## Customization

After your first run, you'll find a config file here:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\Plugins\NarcoBoatsRPH.ini
```

Edit it with Notepad to customize:
- Number of boats per wave
- Number of waves
- Which helicopter you spawn in
- Where you spawn (Beach, Fort, or Random)
- How many drug packages appear on boats
- What hotkey starts the mission

## Where to Get Help

1. Read the full README.txt for detailed info
2. Check RagePluginHook.log if something goes wrong
3. Post in LSPDFR forums for support
4. Make sure you're using the latest version
